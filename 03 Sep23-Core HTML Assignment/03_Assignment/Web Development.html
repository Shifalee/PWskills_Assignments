        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p> Web development is the process of creating,
            building, and maintaining websites and web applications.
            It can involve a range of activities, from developing
            a simple page to complex applications. 
            
           <br>
           A web developer's job is to create websites.
           While their primary role is to ensure the 
           website is visually appealing and easy to navigate,
           many web developers are also responsible 
           for the website's performance and capacity.
