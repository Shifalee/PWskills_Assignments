        <h1>Web Design</h1>
        <p> Web design is the process of planning, 
            conceptualizing, and implementing a website
            that is functional and offers a good user 
            experience. 
           <br>
            Web designers are responsible for 
            the visual appearance and layout of a website.
            They work closely with clients to understand 
            their needs and goals, and then they create 
            a design that is both aesthetically pleasing 
            and user-friendly.
