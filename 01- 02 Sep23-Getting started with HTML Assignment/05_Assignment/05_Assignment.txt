//What is the Doctype Declaration in HTML?//


     1. The HTML document type declaration (DOCTYPE) is the first line of code in every HTML
        or XHTML document. It tells the web browser what version of HTML the page is written in.
        This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers. 

     2.The HTML doctype is not a tag or element of the HTML. It tells the browser about the
       specifications like the version of the HTML or the standards. 

     3.DOCTYPEs are a key component of compliant web pages: your markup and CSS won't validate
       without them.

     4.The most common declaration, <!DOCTYPE html>, indicates the use of HTML5, the 
       latest version of HTML.
