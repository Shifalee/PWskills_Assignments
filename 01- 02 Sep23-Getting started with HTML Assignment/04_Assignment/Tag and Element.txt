HTML Tags:- HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will
            format and display the content. With the help of tags, a web browser 
            can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML 
            tags contain three main parts: opening tag, content and closing tag.
            But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

 Syntax-  <tag> content </tag>
 Example- <p> This is tag example. </p>
          In this example, <p> is the opening tag, and </p> is the closing tag. 
          The content "This is tag example." is the text within the paragraph element.



HTML Element:-An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for
              creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in 
              HTML usually consist of a start tag <tag name>, close tag </tag name> 
              and content inserted between them.An element is a collection
              of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them.

  Example- <p> This is a paragraph element.</p>
            In this example, <p> is the opening tag, "This is a paragraph element."
            is the content, and </p> is the closing tag.Together, they form the 
            complete <p> element, representing a paragraph of text.
