/*Describe the purpose and usage of the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs in web development . Give suitable example for each. */


The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs are part of the Web Storage API in JavaScript, providing mechanisms for storing key-value pairs locally within the user's browser. 

localStorage:

1.Purpose- localStorage allows developers to store data with no expiration date. The data persists even after the browser window is closed and across browser sessions.

2.Usage- Data stored in localStorage remains available until explicitly removed by the web application or cleared by the user.

Example: Storing user preferences or settings that persist across browser sessions.

// Storing data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark');

// Retrieving data from localStorage
var theme = localStorage.getItem('theme');
console.log('Theme:', theme); 


sessionStorage:

1.Purpose- sessionStorage allows developers to store data for the duration of the page session. The data is cleared when the page session ends (e.g., when the browser tab is closed).

2.Usage- Data stored in sessionStorage is available only within the same browser tab or window where it was set.

Example: Storing temporary user data or state information needed for the current session.

// Storing data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem('username', 'exampleUser');

// Retrieving data from sessionStorage
var username = sessionStorage.getItem('username');
console.log('Username:', username);
