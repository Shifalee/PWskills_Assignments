<!--Explain the difference between justify-items and justify-self using code example-->

Justify-items: The justify-items property is set on the grid container to give child elements
              (grid items) alignment in the inline direction.

Example:   #container {
             display: grid;
            justify-items: center;
             }



Justify-self : The justify-self property aligns a grid item within its grid cell 
              in the inline direction.inline direction is left to right and block 
direction is downward.

Example:   .red {
                display: grid;
                justify-self: right;
               }
