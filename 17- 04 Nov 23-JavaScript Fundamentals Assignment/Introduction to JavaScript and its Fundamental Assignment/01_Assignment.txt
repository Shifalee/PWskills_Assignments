<!--1: Explain what JavaScript is and its role in web development.->


JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by Web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience for the user. Most of the functions and applications that make the Internet indispensable to modern life are coded in some form of JavaScript.



JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), which represents the webpage's structure. This
interaction enables developers to manipulate and modify webpage content, styles, and layout in response to
user actions. JavaScript also handles events, making it possible to create interactive web applications.

            JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, crucial for tasks like sending and receiving
data from web servers without blocking the user interface. It has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as React and Angular, that simplify and accelerate web development.
