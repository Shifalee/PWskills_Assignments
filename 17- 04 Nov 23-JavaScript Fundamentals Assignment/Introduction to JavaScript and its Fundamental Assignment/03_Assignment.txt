Five Primitive datatypes in JavaScript.

1.Number - Number data type in javascript can be used to hold decimal values as well as values without    
        decimals.
Example- 
let integerNumber = 42;
let floatingPointNumber = 3.14;
let notANumber = NaN;
let positiveInfinity = Infinity;

2.String- The string data type in JavaScript represents a sequence of characters that are surrounded by 
        single or double quotes.
Example-
let str = 'Hello All';
let str1 = "Welcome to, my new house";
let templateLiteral = `My name is ${name}`;

3.Undefined- The undefined data type represents a variable that has been declared but has not been 
            assigned a value. It is often the initial value of variables.
Example-
let firstName; // firstName is undefined

4.Boolean- The boolean data type has only two values, true and false, and is used to represent logical 
         values. Booleans are commonly used for conditions and comparisons.
Example-
let isUserLoggedIn = true;
let isDataValid = false;

5.Null- The null data type represents the intentional absence of any object value or a value that has been 
       explicitly set to indicate no value. It is often used to initialize variables before assigning meaningful values.
Example-
let address = null;
