<!--What are conditional statements?Explain conditional statement with syntax and example.-->

Conditional Statements- Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of code based on conditions. If the condition meets then a particular block of action will be executed otherwise it will execute another block of action that satisfies that particular condition.

1.if Statement
2.if-else Statement
3.Nested if Statement
4.else if Statement
5.switch Statement
6.Ternary Operator

1.if Statement-: The if statement is used to evaluate a particular condition. If the condition holds true, the associated code block is executed.

Syntax- 
 if ( condition ) {
// If the condition is met, 
 //code  will get executed.
 }
Example-   
let num = 20; 
if (num % 2 === 0) { 
console.log("Given number is even number."); 
} 

2.if-else Statement-: The if-else statement will perform some action for a specific condition. Here we are using the else statement in which the else statement is written after the if statement and it has no condition in their code block.

Syntax- 
if (condition1) {
    // Executes when condition1 is true
    }
    else {
    // Executes when condition1 is false
     }
Example-
let age = 25; 
if (age >= 18) { 
    console.log("You are eligible of driving licence") 
} else { 
    console.log("You are not eligible for driving licence") 
};

3.Nested if Statement-: We can nest if else statements inside another if else statements.
Syntax-
if(condition1){
    if(condition2){
        //We can add as many nested if as we want
    }
}
Example-
if(isLoggedIn){
    if(isAdmin){
        console.log("The logged in user is admin.");
    }
    else{
        console.log("The logged in user is not an admin.");
    }
}

4.else-if Statement-: The else if statement in JavaScript allows handling multiple possible conditions and outputs, evaluating more than two options based on whether the conditions are true or false.
Syntax-
if (1st condition) {
    // Code for 1st condition
} else if (2nd condition) {
    // ode for 2nd condition
} else if (3rd condition) {
    // Code for 3rd condition
} else {
    //  ode that will execute if all 
    // above conditions are false
}
Example-
const num = 0; 
  
if (num > 0) { 
    console.log("Given number is positive."); 
} else if (num < 0) { 
    console.log("Given number is negative."); 
} else { 
    console.log("Given number is zero."); 
};

5.Switch Statement-:As the number of conditions increases, you can use multiple else-if statements in JavaScript. but when we dealing with many conditions, the switch statement may be a more preferred option.
Syntax-
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        statement1;
        break;
    case value2:
        statement2;
        break;
    . . .
    case valueN:
        statementN;
        break;
    default:
        statementDefault;
};
Example-
const marks = 85; 
  
let Branch; 
  
switch (true) { 
    case marks >= 90: 
        Branch = "Computer science engineering"; 
        break; 
    case marks >= 80: 
        Branch = "Mechanical engineering"; 
        break; 
    case marks >= 70: 
        Branch = "Chemical engineering"; 
        break; 
    case marks >= 60: 
        Branch = "Electronics and communication"; 
        break; 
    case marks >= 50: 
        Branch = "Civil engineering"; 
        break; 
    default: 
        Branch = "Bio technology"; 
        break; 
} 
  
console.log(`Student Branch name is : ${Branch}`);

6.Ternary Operator-:The conditional operator, also referred to as the ternary operator (?:), is a shortcut for expressing conditional statements in JavaScript.
Syntax-
condition ? value if true : value if false
Example-
let age = 21; 
  
const result = (age >= 18) ? "You are eligible to vote.": "You are not eligible to vote."; 
  
console.log(result);
