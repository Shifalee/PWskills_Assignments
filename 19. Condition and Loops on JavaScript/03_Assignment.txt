<!--What are loops ,and what do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.-->

Loops-: Loops are used in programming to repeatedly run a block of code.
 Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true.

1.for Loop
2. While Loop
3. Do While Loop

1.for Loop-We use for loop to run a piece of code until the set condition turns false.

syntax-
for (initialization;  condition; increment/decrement) {
    statement(s)
}
Example-
for(let i=0;i<3;i++)
{
    let name="Shifalee"
    console.log(name);
}

2.While Loop-This loop keeps on running as long as the condition is true.

syntax-
while (boolean condition) {
    loop statements...
}
Example-
let x = 5;
 
while (x == 5) {
    console.log("In the loop");
}

3.Do while Loop- Do while is similar to while loop with one difference that the 1st iteration runs always, and
later iterations run after the condition evaluates to true.

Syntax-
do {
    Statements..
}
while (condition);
Example-
let result='';
let i=0;
do{
    i=i+1;
    result=result+i;
}
while(i<7);
console.log(result);
