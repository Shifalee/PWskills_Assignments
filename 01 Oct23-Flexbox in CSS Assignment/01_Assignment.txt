<!--Q1. Describe the main` difference` between` the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model
When would you choose to use one over the another?

The Key difference between the Flexbox and CSS Grid Laout models
lies in their layout strategies and how they handle the arrangement
of elements:

Flexbox Layout:

1.Dimensionality and Flexibility: Flexbox offers greater control over alignment and space 
                                  distribution between items. Being one-dimensional, Flexbox 
only deals with either columns or rows.
2.Alignment: Flex Direction allows developers to align elements vertically or horizontally, 
             which is used when developers create and reverse rows or columns.
3.Item Management: Flex Container is the parent element while Flex Item represents the children. 
                   The Flex Container can ensure balanced representation by adjusting item dimensions.
This allows developers to design for fluctuating screen sizes.


Grid Layout:

1.Dimensionality and Flexibility: Grid has two-dimension layout capabilities which allow flexible 
                                 widths as a unit of length. This compensates for the limitations in Flex.
2.Alignment: CSS Grid deploys fractional measure units for grid fluidity and auto-keyword functionality
             to automatically adjust columns or rows.
3.Item Management:Grid supports both implicit and explicit content placement. Its inbuilt automation
                 allows it to automatically extend line items and copy values into the new creation 
from the preceding item.
