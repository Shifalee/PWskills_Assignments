<!--What are the benefits of using meta tags-->


The Benefits of using Meta tags are as follows-

1. SEO - (Search Engine Optimization): Meta tags, such as the "description" and "keywords" tags,
        can help improve a webpage's visibility on search engine result pages (SERPs).

2.Social Media Sharing - Meta tags like the Open Graph Protocol tags allow developers to control 
                         how web pages are displayed when shared on social media platforms like
Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.

3.Character Encoding and Language - The meta tag specifying the character encoding (e.g., .TF-8)
                                    ensures that the browser interprets the text correctly, especially 
when dealing with special characters or multilingual content.

4. Viewport control - The viewport meta tag is crucial for responsive web design.

5. HTTP-Equiv tags - Meta tags with http-equiv attribute (e.g., <meta http-equiv="refresh">) 
                    enable specific HTTP header functionalities, like refreshing or redirecting
 the page after a certain time.
